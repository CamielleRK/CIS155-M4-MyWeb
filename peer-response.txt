I am adding my own ideas for improvements because I did not recieve peer suggestions. 

X fix the redbubble link so it opens in a new tab 
X create a resource page for people interested in art using numbered lines  
X make a list of things to do for starting art projects 
X fix links so they are easier to see per peer request  

List of other requirements and extra credit 
X add or use a new font 
X use one or more icons on your website from a service like fontawesome 
X add a favicon to your website that is appropriate for the purpose of your webpage 
X Add a table to your website 
X add comments to your submission so it indicates changes
