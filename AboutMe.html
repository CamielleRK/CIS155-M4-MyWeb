                    <h2>On the path of figuring out whats next</h2>
                    <p> While a certain amount of change is always inevitable I went through a ton of change last year, 
                        far more than expected. After working as a counselor for 6 years I realized that it was time 
                        to make a change and figure out something new. Different part time jobs and going to school 
                        going through a process of growth and discovery. </p>
                    <p> I have lived in california, nevada and louisiana in addition to washington. I have traveled to canada, mexico, 
                        alaska, hawaii, costa rica, germany, italy, japan, and soon to have the pleasure of spain. Besides documentary 
                        style photography I am also deeply passionate about writing and illustration. I have ran an etsy store for years 
                        in the past and this year I decided to get back into that branch of exploring art and what I am capable of making. 
                        Out of all my hobbies though film photography and illustration are the biggest and I am in the process of figuring
                        out how I can incorporate those and grow in them this year. For illustration I am working on selling art I create as stickers
                        and for photography I am doing a instant photography project this year. We will see where all this leads.
