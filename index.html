                    <h2>Digital Illustration of me working on my goals</h2>
                    <p> I have always been the kind of person who is a jack of all trades and 
                        master of none. Learning to do many things but not ever going one direction
                        and its both a blessing and a curse. I admire people who have the discipline 
                        to become incredible at one or even a few things but I also am glad I have the 
                        willingness to try so many things even if I end up being mediocre at many of them. </p>
                    <p> I like taking this class because it is mix of technical and artistic and Photography
                        along with a few other of my hobbies can be like that as well. There is mechanics to 
                        what you are doing that are the building blocks you have to learn to manipulate 
                        dependent on the situation in order to produce your vision. It can be a frusterating 
                        process at times but also quite a rewarding one.
